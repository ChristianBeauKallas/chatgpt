For this exercise, here was the prompt that I provided ChatGPT:
    
    I  am in day 3 of a full stack web development bootcamp. We've been working in GitHub and I'm starting to get familiar. Let's say I'm interviewing for a jr developer role, what might be a question I  get in regards to Git Hub

Here was ChatGPT's Response:

During a junior developer interview, it's common to be asked questions related to Git and GitHub. Here's a potential question you might encounter:

"What is the difference between Git and GitHub, and how do they work together?"
This question assesses your understanding of the basic concepts behind version control and how Git and GitHub are related. Here's a breakdown of a suitable response:

Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes, collaborate on projects, and manage source code history. It provides functionalities like branching, merging, and committing changes.

GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It acts as a remote repository where developers can store and share their Git repositories with others. It provides additional features like issue tracking, pull requests, collaboration tools, and project management capabilities.

When working on a project, you typically clone a repository from GitHub onto your local machine using Git. You can then make changes, commit them to your local repository, and push those changes back to the remote repository on GitHub. This allows for collaboration with other developers and provides a centralized location for managing the project.

It's important to note that there are other alternatives to GitHub, such as GitLab and Bitbucket, which offer similar functionalities but may have different features and hosting options.

Remember to provide a concise and clear explanation, demonstrating your understanding of the core concepts and how Git and GitHub work together in a typical development workflow.
